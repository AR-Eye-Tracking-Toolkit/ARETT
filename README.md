# ARETT: Augmented Reality Eye Tracking Toolkit for Head Mounted Displays

This is a toolkit for Unity 3D which contains scripts for acquiring eye tracking data on the Microsoft HoloLens 2.

## Documentation

Documentation about the usage of the toolkit can be found in the [projects wiki](https://github.com/AR-Eye-Tracking-Toolkit/ARETT/wiki). Background information is provided in the [associated publication](#reference).

## Analysis package

An accompaning package for analysis of the acquired data using R can be found in the [ARETT R Package](https://github.com/AR-Eye-Tracking-Toolkit/ARETT-R-Package) repository.

## Demo Application

A sample application integrating the toolkit into Unity project can be found in the [ARETT Demo](https://github.com/AR-Eye-Tracking-Toolkit/ARETT-Demo) repository.

## Dependencies

The toolkit is currently being developed for [Unity](https://unity.com/releases/2019-lts) [2019.4.20f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.20) and the [Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) [v2.5.4](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/tag/v2.5.4). However, it should work with all releases of the Unity 2019.4 LTS branch and future releases of Mixed Reality Toolkit. Compatibility with future versions of Unity is likely but not guranteed.
